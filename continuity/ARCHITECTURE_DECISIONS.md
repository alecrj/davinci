# ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS - DaVinci Technical Foundation

## 🏢 BILLION-DOLLAR ARCHITECTURE RATIONALE

### ADR-001: React Native + Expo Router Selection
**Date**: $(date)
**Status**: Adopted
**Decision**: Use React Native with Expo Router for primary development framework

**Context**: 
- Need cross-platform development for iOS and Android
- Target 100M+ users requires scalable architecture
- Team has JavaScript/TypeScript expertise
- Budget constraints require development efficiency

**Options Considered**:
1. **Native iOS/Android** - Maximum performance, double development cost
2. **Flutter** - Good performance, Dart learning curve, smaller ecosystem
3. **React Native** - Proven at scale, large ecosystem, TypeScript support

**Decision Rationale**:
- ✅ **Proven at scale**: Instagram, Discord, Uber Eats use React Native successfully
- ✅ **Development efficiency**: Single codebase for iOS and Android
- ✅ **Performance**: New Architecture provides native-level performance
- ✅ **Team expertise**: Leverages existing JavaScript/React knowledge
- ✅ **Ecosystem**: Mature ecosystem with extensive libraries
- ✅ **Expo Router**: Modern file-based routing following Next.js patterns

**Performance Requirements Met**:
- 60fps drawing performance achievable with React Native Skia
- Native module access for haptic feedback and device features
- iOS App Store quality standards achievable

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Discord: 98% code sharing, 4.8 App Store rating, millions of users
- Instagram: Smooth performance with complex animations
- Uber Eats: Real-time features with native-level performance

### ADR-002: TypeScript Adoption
**Date**: $(date)
**Status**: Adopted  
**Decision**: Use TypeScript throughout the entire codebase

**Context**:
- Complex app with multiple features and data flows
- Multi-developer team collaboration (current and future)
- Enterprise-grade reliability requirements
- Long-term maintainability critical

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Type safety**: Catches errors at compile time vs runtime
- ✅ **Developer experience**: Better IDE support and refactoring
- ✅ **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation
- ✅ **Scalability**: Critical for complex apps with multiple developers
- ✅ **Industry standard**: Billion-dollar companies use TypeScript

### ADR-003: Expo Router vs React Navigation
**Date**: $(date)
**Status**: Adopted
**Decision**: Use Expo Router for navigation instead of React Navigation

**Context**:
- Need scalable navigation system for complex app structure
- File-based routing becoming industry standard (Next.js, etc.)
- Development team familiar with modern web patterns

**Advantages of Expo Router**:
- ✅ **File-based routing**: More intuitive and maintainable
- ✅ **TypeScript integration**: Better type safety for navigation
- ✅ **Modern patterns**: Follows Next.js conventions familiar to developers
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized for mobile performance
- ✅ **Future-proof**: Latest navigation solution from Expo team

### ADR-004: iPhone 15 Pro Primary Testing Device
**Date**: $(date)
**Status**: Adopted
**Decision**: Use iPhone 15 Pro as primary development and testing device

**Context**:
- iOS-first strategy for premium market positioning
- Need high-performance device for 60fps drawing testing
- Target audience uses premium iOS devices

**Justification**:
- ✅ **Premium target market**: iOS users willing to pay premium prices
- ✅ **Performance validation**: Latest hardware ensures smooth experience
- ✅ **App Store optimization**: Testing on flagship device
- ✅ **Real device testing**: Simulator cannot replicate true performance

### ADR-005: Component-Based Architecture
**Date**: $(date)
**Status**: Adopted
**Decision**: Implement feature-based component architecture

**Structure**:
```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── confidence/      # Confidence transformation features
│   ├── microlessons/    # 3-minute lesson system
│   ├── ai/              # AI encouragement components
│   └── social/          # Social features without shame
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks for business logic
├── context/             # React context for global state
├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/               # Pure utility functions
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Reusability**: Components can be reused across features
- ✅ **Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without conflicts

### ADR-006: Performance Targets
**Date**: $(date)
**Status**: Adopted
**Decision**: Establish specific performance targets for billion-dollar app quality

**Performance Requirements**:
- **Drawing Performance**: 60fps consistency during touch drawing
- **App Launch Time**: <3 seconds cold start on iPhone 15 Pro
- **Touch Latency**: <16ms touch response for drawing canvas
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for optimal iOS performance
- **Crash Rate**: <0.1% (App Store quality standard)

**Rationale**:
- Premium iOS apps must meet App Store performance standards
- Drawing experience critical to confidence transformation mission
- Performance directly impacts user retention and satisfaction

### ADR-007: Git Workflow and Version Control
**Date**: $(date)
**Status**: Adopted
**Decision**: Use GitHub with descriptive commit messages and branch strategy

**Workflow**:
- **Main branch**: Production-ready code only
- **Feature branches**: Individual features developed in isolation
- **Commit messages**: Descriptive, following conventional commits
- **Documentation**: All changes documented in continuity system

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- ✅ **History**: Clear development progression tracking
- ✅ **Rollback**: Easy to revert problematic changes
- ✅ **Professional**: Industry-standard development practices
