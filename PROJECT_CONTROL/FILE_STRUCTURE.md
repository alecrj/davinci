### 🎯 **WHAT NEEDS FINAL COMPLETION (40 errors)**
```yaml
Drawing Context Types (11 errors): NEXT TARGET - HIGH PRIORITY
- DrawingTool: Missing 'name' property for tool identification
- DetectedShape: null vs undefined initialization mismatch
- Undo/redo stacks: Point[][] vs DrawingPath[] type consistency needed
- Impact: Drawing system undo/redo functionality requires completion

Component Interface Alignment (12 errors): MEDIUM PRIORITY  
- Button: StyleProp<TextStyle> array handling refinement needed
- CircleChallenge: Missing width/height props alignment
- MagicTransformation: Missing shape/originalPath props integration
- Impact: Advanced component features may have minor issues

Navigation Router Types (3 errors): LOW PRIORITY
- Expo Router: Strict typing for dynamic routes
- Impact: Some navigation calls have type warnings only

Gradient Type Conversions (8 errors): LOW PRIORITY
- LinearGradient: string[] to readonly tuple conversion
- Impact: Some gradient backgrounds need helper usage
