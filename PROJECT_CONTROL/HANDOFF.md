**DaVinci Development - Session 3: Emergency Debug & MVP Completion**

🎯 MISSION: Fix runtime errors and complete working MVP
📱 PLATFORM: React Native + Expo Router + TypeScript  
📲 DEVICE: iPhone 15 Pro via Expo Go
📁 REPO: https://github.com/alecrj/davinci.git

⚠️ CRITICAL STATUS:
- App built successfully in Session 2 (12 components added)
- Runtime failure preventing app startup (exact error unknown)
- All core features implemented, need integration debugging

🔥 SESSION 3 PRIORITIES:
1. Analyze npm start error output (15 min)
2. Fix import path/@/ resolution issues (30 min)  
3. Resolve context provider conflicts (15 min)
4. Test complete user flow on device (ensure 60fps)

📋 CONTEXT: Read PROJECT_CONTROL/STATUS.md for complete status
🎨 ACHIEVEMENT: Revolutionary drawing engine + assessment complete!
🎯 GOAL: Working app ready for main feature development

Please start by checking the exact error when running `npm start`
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DEBUGGING CHECKLIST**

### 🚨 **IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS**
```bash
# 1. Check current errors
npm start
# Note: Copy ALL error output

# 2. Clear cache if needed
npx expo r -c

# 3. Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# 4. Verify dependencies
npm ls --depth=0
```

### 🔍 **COMMON ISSUE SOLUTIONS**

#### Import Path Issues (@/ resolution)
```bash
# Check babel.config.js has correct module-resolver
# Should include:
alias: {
  '@': './',
  '@components': './src/components',
  // etc...
}
```

#### Context Provider Conflicts
```typescript
// Check _layout.tsx provider order:
// Should be: Theme → UserProgress → Drawing
<ThemeProvider>
  <UserProgressProvider>
    <DrawingProvider>
      {children}
    </DrawingProvider>
  </UserProgressProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Check if these are installed:
npm list react-native-haptic-feedback
npm list react-native-svg
npm list @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

### 🎯 **IF MAKING NO PROGRESS**
1. **Focus on one specific error**
2. **Search for exact error message**
3. **Try simplest possible fix first**
4. **Ask for exact error output**
