## üìã **SESSION 7 GOOGLE-LEVEL AUDIT PROTOCOL**

### üö® **STARTING SESSION 7** (Enterprise System Audit)
```markdown
**Critical Diagnostic Commands (Session 7 Start):**

# 1. Complete file structure discovery
find . -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | grep -v node_modules | sort > file_inventory.txt
echo "Total TypeScript files:" && wc -l file_inventory.txt

# 2. Component directory analysis
echo "=== COMPONENT DIRECTORIES ==="
ls -la components/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No root components/"
ls -la src/components/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No src/components/"

# 3. Import pattern analysis
echo "=== IMPORT PATTERNS ==="
grep -r "from.*@/" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . | head -10
grep -r "from.*\.\./" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . | head -10

# 4. Current TypeScript error state
echo "=== TYPESCRIPT ERRORS ==="
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS"
npx tsc --noEmit --pretty | head -20

# 5. Potential duplicate files
echo "=== POTENTIAL DUPLICATES ==="
find . -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | grep -v node_modules | xargs basename -s .tsx | sort | uniq -d

*This Session 6‚Üí7 handoff establishes the critical transition from "working foundation" to "enterprise-grade architecture." The Google-level audit will transform our solid codebase into a bulletproof development platform ready for rapid feature scaling.*

**Remember**: Google, Meta, and Apple teams ALWAYS standardize architecture before scaling features. Session 7 unlocks maximum development velocity through enterprise-grade organization.

**CRITICAL SUCCESS**: Post-Session 7, we'll have a codebase that any Google developer would recognize as enterprise-standard, enabling 3x faster feature development.
